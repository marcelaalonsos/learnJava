Manipulating Variables Introduction

Java has built-in arithmetic operarations that perform calculations on numeric values:
// declare initial balance
double balance = 20000.99;
// declare deposit amount
double depositAmount = 1000.00;
// store result of calculation in our original variable
balance = balance + depositAmount;

When an expression is executed, it produces a single value
The data types of an expression is determined by the resulting value. For examples, an expression that uses 2 int values will evaluate to an int value. If an expression contains a double value, then the resulting value will also be type double.
