Greater Than and Less Than

Java has relational operators for numeric dataypes that make boolean comparisons.
These include less than (<) and greater than (>)
double balance = 20000.01;
double amountToWithdraw = 5000.01;
System.out.print(amountToWithdraw < balance);
//this will print true, since amountToWithdraw is less than balance

You can save the result of a comparison as a boolean.
double myBalance = 200.05;
double costOfBuyingNewLaptop = 1000.05;
boolean canBuyLaptop = myBalance > costOfBuyingNewLaptop;
//canBuyLaptop is false, since 200.05 is not more than 1000.05
