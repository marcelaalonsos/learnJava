Multiplication and Division

Division has different results with integers. The / operator does integer division, which means that any remainder is lost:
int evenlyDivided = 10 / 5;
//evenlyDivided holds 2, because 10 divided by 5 is 2
int unevenlyDivided = 10 / 4;
//unevenlyDivided holds 2, because 10 divided by 4 is 2.5

int cannot store decimals
int does not round the decimal, but floors int
If we try to divide any number by 0, we will get an ArithmeticException error as a result
