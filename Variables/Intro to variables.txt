Introduction: Variables

In Java, we specify the type of information we're storing.
Primitive data types are types of data built-in to the Java System.
The 3 main primitive types: int, double, and boolean
We must declare a variable to reference it within our program. Declaring a variable requires that we specify the type and name:
// datatype variableName
int age;
double salaryRequirement;
boolean isEmployed;

To assign a value to a variable, we use the assignment operator =
age = 85

When code is used to represent a fixed value, like 85, it is referred to as a literal.
It's also common to declare a variable and assign it a value in one line.
int yearCodecademyWasFounded = 2011;
