Static Checking

The java programming language has static typing, meaning it will not compile if a variable is assigned a value of an incorrect type.
This is a type of declaration bug.

The program will not compile if the declared type of the variable does not match the type of the assigned value:
int greeting = "Hello World";
The String "Hello World" cannot be held in a variable of type int.

For the example above, we see an error in the console at compilation:

error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int
    int greeting = "Hello World";
When bugs are not caught at compilation, they interrupt execution of the code by causing runtime errors. The program will crash.

Javaâ€™s static typing helps programmers avoid runtime errors, and thus have much safer code that is free from bugs.
