String

String hold sequences of characters.
String is an object, with built-in behaviors.

There are 2 ways to create a String object:
- using a string literal, or
- calling the string class to create a new string object

A String literal is any sequence of characters enclosed in double-quotes "".
We declare a String variable by specifying that type first:
String greeting = "Hello World";

We can also create a new String object by calling the string class when declaring a string:
String salutations = new String("Hello World");

Escape sequences
- are interpreted differently by the compiler than other characters
- begin with the character \

There are 3 escape sequences to be aware of:
1. The \ escape sequence allows to add quotation marks to a String value:
System.out.println("\"Hello World\"");
// Prints: "Hello World"
if we didn't use an escape sequence, java would think we're using " to end the string

2. Using the \\ escape sequence allows us to place backslashes in our string text:
System.out.println("This is the backslash symbol: \\");
// Prints: This is the backslash symbol: \

3. if we place \n escape sequence in a string, the compiler will output a new line of text:
System.out.println("Hello\nGoodbye");
/*
Prints:
Hello
Goodbye
*/
you can think of \n as the escape sequence for "new line"
