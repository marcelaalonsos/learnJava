.equals()

With objects such as String, we can't use the primitive equality operator. To test equality with objects, we use a built-in method called .equals()
When comparing objects, make sure to always use .equals()
== will work occasionally, but the reason why it sometimes works has to do with how objects are stored in memory.
To use it, we call it on one String, by using . and pass in the string to compare against in parentheses:
String person1 = "Paul";
String person2 = "John";
String person3 = "Paul";

System.out.println(person1.equals(person2));
// Prints false, since "Paul" is not "John"

System.out.println(person1.equals(person3));
// Prints true, since "Paul" is "Paul"
