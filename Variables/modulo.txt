MODULO

The modulo operator % gives us the remainder after 2 numbers are divided:
int cookiesBaked = 10;
int cookiesLeftover = 10 % 3;
//cookiesLeftover holds 1

Modulo can help determine whether a number is even or odd.
Dividing an even number by 2 will have a remainder of 0.
Dividing an odd number by 2 will have a remainder of 1.

7 % 2
// 1, odd!
8 % 2
// 0, even!
9 % 2
// 1, odd!
