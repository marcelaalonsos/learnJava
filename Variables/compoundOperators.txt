Compound Assigment Operators

Compound assigment operators perform an arithmetic operation on a variable and then reassigns its value. Using the += compound assigment operator, it adds and reassigns the variable's value:
int numCupcakes = 12;
numCupcakes += 8; // Value is now 20

we can use compound assigment operators for all the arithmetic operators:
addition +=
susbtraction -=
multiplication *=
division /=
modulo %=
