Naming

Naming variables according to convention leads to clear, readable and maintable code.
In Java, variable names are case-sensitive. myHeight is a different variable from myheight.
A variable starts with a valid letter, or a $ or _
No other symbols or numbers can begin a variable name

1. variable names of only one work are spelled in all lowercase letters
2. variable names of more than one word are camelCase

// good style
boolean isHuman;

// bad styles
// no capitalization for new word
boolean ishuman;
// first word should be lowercase
boolean IsHuman;
// underscores don't separate words
boolean is_human;
