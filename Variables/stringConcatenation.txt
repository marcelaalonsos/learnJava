String Concatenation

The + operator can be used to concatenate String. In other words, we can use it to join 2 strings together.
String username = "PrinceNelson";
System.out.println("Your username is: " + username);

The code will print:
Your username is: PrinceNelson

We can use a primitve datatype as the second variable to concatenate, and Java will intelligently make it a string first:
int balance = 10000;
String message = "Your balance is: " + balance;
System.out.println(message);

the code will print:
Your balance is: 10000
