Greater/Less Than or Equal To

How could we make sure we got paid at least the amount we expected in our paycheck? We could use greater than or equal to, >=, or less than or equal to, <=

double paycheckAmount = 620;
double calculatedPaycheck = 15.50 * 40;
System.out.println(paycheckAmount >= calculatedPaycheck);
//this will print true, since paycheckAmount equals calculatedPaycheck
