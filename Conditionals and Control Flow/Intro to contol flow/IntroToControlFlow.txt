Introduction to Control Flow

We represent decision making in our program using conditional or control flow statements. Before this point, our code runs line-by-line from the top down, but conditional statements allow us to be selective in which portions will run.

Conditional statements check a boolean condition and run a block of code depending on the condition. {} mark the scope of a conditional block similar to a method or class.

if (true) {

  System.out.println("Hello World!");

}

If the condition is true, then the block will run.

if (false) {

  System.out.println("Hello World!");

}

If the condition is false, the code does not run.
This code is also called if-then statements: if condition is true, then do something
