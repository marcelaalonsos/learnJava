Nested Conditional statements

We can create more complex conditional structures by creating nested conditional statements, which is created by placing conditional statements inside other conditional statements:
if (outer condition) {
  if (nested condition) {
    Instruction to execute if both conditions are true
  }
}

When we implement nested conditional statements, the outer statement is evaluated first. If the outer condition is true, then the inner, nested statement is evaluated:
int temp = 45;
boolean raining = true;

if (temp < 60) {
  System.out.println("Wear a jacket!");
  if (raining == true) {
    System.out.println("Bring your umbrella.");
  } else {
    System.out.println("Leave your umbrella home.");
  }
}

In the code above, our compiler will check the condition in the first if-then statement: temp <60. since temp has a value of 45. this condition is true, therefore our program will print wear a jacket.

Then, it will evaluate the condition of the nested if-then statement: raining == true. this condition is also true, so bring your umbrella is also printed on the screen.

*Note that, if the first condition was false, the nested condition would not be evaluated.
