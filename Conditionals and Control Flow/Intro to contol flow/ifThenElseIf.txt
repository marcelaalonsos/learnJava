If-Then-Else-If

The conditional structure we've learned can be chained together to check as many conditions as are required by our program.
The conditional statement now has multiple conditions that are evaluated from the top down:
String course = "Theatre";

if (course.equals("Biology")) {

  // Enroll in Biology course

} else if (course.equals("Algebra")) {

  // Enroll in Algebra course

} else if (course.equals("Theatre")) {

  // Enroll in Theatre course

} else {

  System.out.println("Course not found!");

}

The first condition to evaluate to true will have that code block run.
int testScore = 72;

if (testScore >= 90) {

  System.out.println("A");

} else if (testScore >= 80) {

  System.out.println("B");

} else if (testScore >= 70) {

  System.out.println("C");

} else if (testScore >= 60) {

  System.out.println("D");

} else {

  System.out.println("F");

}
// prints: C

This chained conditional statement has two conditions that evaluate true. Because testScore >= 70 comes before testScore >= 60, only the earlier code block is run.

*Note: Only one of the code blocks will run.
