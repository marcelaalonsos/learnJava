if-Then statement

The if-then statement is the most simple control flow we can write. It tests an expression for truth and executes some code based on it.
if (flip == 1) {

  System.out.println("Heads!");

}

- the if keyword marks the beginning of the conditional statement, followed by ()
- the () hold a boolean datatype

For the condition in () we can also use variables that reference a boolean, or comparissons that evaluate to a boolean.
The boolean condition is followed by {} that mark the block of code. This block runs if, and only if, the boolean is true.
boolean isValidPassword = true;

if (isValidPassword) {

  System.out.println("Password accepted!");

}

// Prints "Password accepted!"

int numberOfItemsInCart = 9;

if (numberOfItemsInCart > 12) {

  System.out.println("Express checkout not available");

}

// Nothing is printed.

If a confitional is brief, we can omit the {} for brevity:
if (true) System.out.println("Brevity is the soul of wit");

*NOTE: conditional statements do not end in a semicolon
