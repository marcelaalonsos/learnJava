Logical NOT: !

The unary operator NOT ! works on a single value. This operator evaluates to the opposite boolean to which it's applied:
!false
// true
!true
// false

NOT us useful for expressing our intent clearly in programs. For example, sometimes we need the opposite behavior of an if-then: run a code only if the condition is false:
boolean hasPrerequisite = false;

if (hasPrerequisite) {
  // do nothing
} else {
  System.out.println("Must complete prerequisite course!");
}

This code does what we want but it's strange to hae a code block that does nothing!
The logical NOT operator cleans the example:
boolean hasPrerequisite = false;

if (!hasPrerequisite) {
  System.out.println("Must complete prerequisite course!");
}

We can write a succint conditional statement without an empty code block.
