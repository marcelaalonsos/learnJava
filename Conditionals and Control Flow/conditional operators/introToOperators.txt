Introduction to Conditional Operators

Java includes operators that only use boolean values. These conditional operators help simplify expressions containing complex boolean relationships by reducing multiple boolean values to a single value: true or false.

What if we want to run a code of block only if multiple conditions are true.
We would use the AND operator: &&

We want to run a code block if at least one of the two conditions are true.
We could use the OR operator: ||

We can produce the opposite value, where true becomes false and false becomes true,
with the NOT operator: !
