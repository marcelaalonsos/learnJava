Commenting Code

// when using single-line syntax
/* */ multi-line syntax

/** */ Javadoc comments are used to create documentation for APIs.
They will eventually be used in the documentation your users might read, so make sure to be thoughtful when writing these comments.
Javadoc comments are typically written before the declaration of fields. methods and classes.
example:
/**
* The following class shows what a comment would look like in a program.
*/
public class CommentExample {
  // I'm a comment inside the class
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // I'm a comment inside a method
    System.out.println("This program has comments!");
  }
}
