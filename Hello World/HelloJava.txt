Think of classes in java as a single concept.
The HelloWorld concept is: Hello World Printer.
We marked the domain on this concept using {}. The syntax inside the curly braces is part of the class.
Each file has one primary class named after the file. Our class name: HelloWorld. every word is capitalized.
Inside the class we have a main() method, which lists our program tasks:

public class HelloYou {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello Marcela!");

  }
}

Like classes, we use {} to mark the begining and end of a method.
public, static, and void are syntax
String[] args is a placeholder for information we want to pass into our program.
Our program also displays the text "Hello World" on the screen. Using a print statement:
System.out.println("Hello World");

*message should be in double quotes
*println has the letter l as in laser
*end statement with semicolon
