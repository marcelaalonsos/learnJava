Semicolons and Whitespace

Java does not interpret whitespace, the areas of code without syntax, but humans use whitespace to read code wihtout difficulty.
Functionally these two code samples are identical:

System.out.println("Java");System.out.println("Lava");System.out.println("Guava");
System.out.println("Java");

System.out.println("Lava");

System.out.println("Guava");

They will print the same text to the screen.
Java DOES interpret semicolons. Semicolons are used to mark the end of an statement, one of code that performs a single task.
There are no semicolons at the end of a curly brace.
