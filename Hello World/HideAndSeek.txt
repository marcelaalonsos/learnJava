Print Statements

Print statements output information to the screen.
System is a built-in Java class that contains useful tools for our programs
out is short for output
println is short for print line

We can use System.out.println() whenever we want the program to create a new line on the screen after outputting a value.
We can also output information using System.out.print(). this will print everything on the same line.
