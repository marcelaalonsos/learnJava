Importing Arrays

If we want to have a more descriptive printout of the array itself, we need a toString() method that is provided by the Arrays package in Java.

import java.util.Arrays;

We put this at the top of the file, before defining the class
When we import a package in Java, we are making all the methods of that package available in our code.
The Arrays package has many useful methods, including:
Arrays.toString()

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Lottery(){

  public static void main(String[] args){
    int[] lotteryNumbers = {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};
    String betterPrintout = Arrays.toString(lotteryNumbers);
    System.out.println(betterPrintout);
  }

}
This code will print:

[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
