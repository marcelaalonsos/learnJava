Creating an Array Explicitly

To create an array, we provide a name and declare the type of data that it holds:
double[] prices;

Just like with variables, we can declare and initialize in the same line.
This allows us to Explicitly initialize the array to contain the data we want to store:
double[] prices = {13.15, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};

We can use arrays to hold String and other objects as well as primitives:
String[] clothingItems = {"Tank Top", "Beanie", "Funny Socks", "Corduroys"};
