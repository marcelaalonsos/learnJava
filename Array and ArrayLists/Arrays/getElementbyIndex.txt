Get Element by index

We use square brackets [] to access data at a certain index:
We use square brackets, [ and ], to access data at a certain index:

double[] prices = {13.1, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};

System.out.println(prices[1]);
This command would print:

15.87

This happens because 15.87 is the item at the 1 index of the array.
The index of an Array starts at 0 and ends at an index of one less than the number of elements in the array.
If we try to access an element outside of its appropiate index range, we will receive an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException error

For example, if we were to run the command System.out.println(prices[5]), weâ€™d get the following output:

java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5
