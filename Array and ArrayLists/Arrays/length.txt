Length

To get the Length of an array, we can access the length field of the array object:
String[] menuItems = new String[5];
System.out.println(menuItems.length);

This command will print 5, since the menuItems array has 5 slots

If we print out the length of the prices array:

double[] prices = {13.1, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};

System.out.println(prices.length);
We would see 4, since there are four items in the prices array!
