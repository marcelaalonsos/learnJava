ArrayList size

If we wanted to display the items of an ArrayList, we could find the size of it using the size() method:
ArrayList<String> shoppingCart = new ArrayList<String>();

shoppingCart.add("Trench Coat");
System.out.println(shoppingCart.size());
// 1 is printed
shoppingCart.add("Tweed Houndstooth Hat");
System.out.println(shoppingCart.size());
// 2 is printed
shoppingCart.add("Magnifying Glass");
System.out.println(shoppingCart.size());
// 3 is printed

In dynamic objects like ArrayLists, itâ€™s important to know how to access the amount of objects we have stored.
