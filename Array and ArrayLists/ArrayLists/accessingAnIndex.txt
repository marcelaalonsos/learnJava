Accessing an index

For ArrayList bracket notation won't work.
instead, we use the method get() to access an index:
ArrayList<String> shoppingCart = new ArrayList<String>();

shoppingCart.add("Trench Coat");
shoppingCart.add("Tweed Houndstooth Hat");
shoppingCart.add("Magnifying Glass");

System.out.println(shoppingCart.get(2));

This code prints "Magnifying Glass", which is the value at index 2 of the ArrayList.
