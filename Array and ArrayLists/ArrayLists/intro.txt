Introduction

When we work with arrays in Java, we've been limited by the fact that once an array is created, it has a fixed size.
We can't add or remove elements.

To create mutable and dynamic lists, we can use Java's ArrayList class.
ArrayList allows us to:
- Store object references as elements
- Store elements of the same type
- Access elements by index
- Add elements
- Remove elements

To use an ArrayList we need to import them from Java's util package:
import java.util.ArrayList;
