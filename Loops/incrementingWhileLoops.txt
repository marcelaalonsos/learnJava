Incrementing While Loops

When looping through code, it's common to use a counter variable.
A counter, is a variable used in the conditional logic of the loop and usually incremented in value during each iteration through the code.
// counter is initialized
int wishes = 0;

// conditional logic uses counter
while (wishes < 3) {

  System.out.println("Wish granted.");
  // counter is incremented
  wishes++;

}

In the example, the counter wishes gets initialized before the loop with a value of 0, then the program will keep printing "wish granted" and adding 1 to wishes, as long as wishes has a value of less than 3.
Once wishes reached a value of 3 or more, the program will exit the loop.

You can also decrement counters:
int pushupsToDo = 10;

while (pushupsToDo > 0) {

  doPushup();
  pushupsToDo--;

}

the counter pushupsToDo starts at 10, and decrements one at a time. when it hits 0, the loop exits.
