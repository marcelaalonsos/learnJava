For Loops

Incrementing with loops is actually so common in programming that Java includes syntax to address this pattern: for loop
A for loop header header is made up of the following three parts, each separated by a semicolon:
1. the initialization of the loop control variable
2. a boolean expression
3. an increment or decrement statement

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

  // code that will run

}

In a for loop, an initialization statement is run once in order to initialize the loop control variable.
This variable is modified in every iteration, can be referenced in the loop body, and used to test the boolean condition.

Let's breakdown the example above:
1. i = 0: i is initilized to 0
2. i < 5: the loop is given a boolean condition that relies on the value of i. the loop will continue to execute until i < 5 is false
3. i++: i will increment at the end of each loop and before the condition is re-evaluated.

the code will run through the loop a total of 5 times.
