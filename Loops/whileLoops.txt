While Loops

A while loop looks a bit like an if statement:
while (silliness > 10) {

  // code to run

}

Like an if statement, the code inside a while loop will only run if the condition is true.
However, a while loop will continue running the code over and over until the condition evaluates to false.

// set attempts to 0
int attempts = 0;

// enter loop if condition is true
while (passcode != 0524 && attempts < 4) {

  System.out.println("Try again.");
  passcode = getNewPasscode();
  attempts += 1;

  // is condition still true?
  // if so, repeat code block
}
// exit when condition is not true

While loops are extremely useful when you want to run some code until a specific change happens.
Infinite loops occur when the condition will never evaluate to false.
This can cause the program to crash.

int hedgehogs = 5;

// This will cause an infinite loop:
while (hedgehogs < 6) {

  System.out.println("Not enough hedgehogs!");

}

in the example above, hedgehogs remains equal to 5, which is less than 6, so we would get an infinite loop.
