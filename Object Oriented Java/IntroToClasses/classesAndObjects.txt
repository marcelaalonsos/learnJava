What are classes and Objects?

Class
A class is a specification of a new data type.
We can define the attributes and functionality in the class.
The inidivual attributes are strings, numbers, and booleans

example:
Student class:
name - string
gpa - number
year - string
hasScholarship - boolean

we can create functions inside the class
hasHonors()
giveScholarship()

OBJECTS
To create a new instance of the class, we need to create an object
