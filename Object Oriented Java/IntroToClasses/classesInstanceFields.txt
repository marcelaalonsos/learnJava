Classes: Instance Fields

When an object is created, the constructor sets the initial state of the object.
The state is made up of associated data that represents the characteristics of an object.
We'll add data to an object by introducing instance variables, or instance fields.
Often times, instance variables are described as a 'has-a' relationship with the object.
Another way to think of this is that instance variables are the nouns and adjectives associated with an object.
public class Car {
  /*
  declare fields inside the class
  by specifying the type and name
  */
  String color;

  public Car() {
    /*
    instance fields available in
    scope of constructor method
    */
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // body of main method
  }
}

The declaration is within the class and the instance variable will be available for assignment inside the constructor.
Fields are a type of state each instance will possess.
