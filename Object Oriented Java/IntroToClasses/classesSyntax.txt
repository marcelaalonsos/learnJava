Classes: Syntax

A class is the set of instructions that describe how an instance can behave and what information it contains.
Java has pre-defined classes such as Systems, which we've used in logging text to our screen, but we also need to write our own classes for the custom needs of a program.

Here's the definition of a Java Class:
public class Car {
// scope of Car class starts after curly brace

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // scope of main() starts after curly brace

    // program tasks

  }
  // scope of main() ends after curly brace

}
// scope of Car class ends after curly brace

public is an access level modifier that allows other classes to interact with this class.
This class has a main() method, which lists the tasks performed by the program.
