Scope

A method is a task that an object of a class performs.
We mark the domain of this task using {}.
Everything inside {} is part of the task. This domain is called the scope of a method.

We can't access variables that are declared inside a method in code that is outside the scope of that method.
class Car {
  String color;
  int milesDriven;

  public Car(String carColor) {
    color = carColor;
    milesDriven = 0;
  }

  public void drive() {
     String message = "Miles driven: " + milesDriven;
     System.out.println(message);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args){
     Car myFastCar = new Car("red");
     myFastCar.drive();
  }
}

The variable message, which is declared and initialized inside of drive, cannot be used inside of main(). it only exists within the scope of the drive() method.
however, milesDriven. which is declared at the top of the class, can be used inside all methods in the class, since it is in the scope of the whole class.
