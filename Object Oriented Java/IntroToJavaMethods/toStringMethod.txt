The toString() Method

When we print objects, we often see a String that is not very helpful in determining what the objec represents.
We saw that printing our Store objects, we got:
Store@6bc7c054

Where Store is the name of the object, and the numbers are its position in memory.
We can add a method to our classes that makes this printout more descriptive.
We can define a toString() method for a class, we can return a String that will print when we print the object:
class Car {

    String color;

    public Car(String carColor) {
        color = carColor;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Car myCar = new Car("red");
        System.out.println(myCar);
    }

   public String toString(){
       return "This is a " + color + " car!";
   }
}

When this runs, the command System.out.println(myCar) will print "This is a red car!" which tells us about the object myCar.
