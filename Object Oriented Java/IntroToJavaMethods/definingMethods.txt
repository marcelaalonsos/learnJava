Defining Methods

If we were to define a checkBalance() method for the savings account example:
public void checkBalance(){
  System.out.println("Hello!");
  System.out.println("Your balance is " + balance);
}

The first line, public void checkBalance() is the method declaration. it gives the program some information about the method:
- public means that other classes can access this method.
- the void keyword means that there is no specific output from the method
- checkBalance() is the name of the method

Every method has its own unique method signature which is comprised of the method's name and its parameter type.
The 2 print statements are inside the body of the method, which is define by {}

*checkBalance() is considered a non-static method because its signature does not include the keyword static like the main() method does.
